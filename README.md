# FriendFinder #

The Friend Finder app takes data from users and compares it with other users' data to find the best match. Using a html/jQuery front end, it takes users' answers to 10 questions as well as their names and photos and compares the answers from other users, finding the user whose answers were most similar.

The app then saves the user's info to an array to compare with future users.

### Routing ###

FriendFinder uses Express for html and api routing and is deployed on Heroku for full-stack functionality.
